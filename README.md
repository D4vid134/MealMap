# MealMap
 Meal Map is a webapp for food lovers, helping users find nearby restaurants and keep a record of their dining experiences. It offers more than just a listâ€”it's a personalized guide to your dining adventures. I developed this web app to showcase my skills in Django, integration with the Google Places API, and frontend work using JavaScript.
